# Simulation Package Configurations

    Simulation/Configurations should contain only one json file, simulation.json, which contains the settings for which/how interactables are simulated, as well as parameters defining the simulated voles that should be created. 

Simulation/Configurations/Example.py contains an example configuration file that can be referenced when creating a new config file. For more information on how to decide what data to place in these files, reference the Simulation Package documentation.
